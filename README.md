#GITHUB PROFILE FINDER.

The GitHub Profile Finder generates the profile of any random Github username inserted.

This is a task given to me by ALT SCHOOL AFRICA.

Here i fetched my github profile using github API.

I displayed the list of my repositories and also displayed some content in each repository clicked using nested routing.

I displayed a separate page called contact to text my errorboundary.

I attached a 404 page for wrong links.

I performed proper SEO, ERRORBOUNDARY, ACCESSIBILITY.

For the newest feature, i added a random github finder.

Overall, i enjoyed working in this task, i got to improve my knowledge on: *Accessibility *SEO *useParams *useContext.

Below is the deployment link.
